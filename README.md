## Cafeteria Menu

**Note**: If the menu is incorrect, that's not because this app is maliciously deceiving you to force you into its own ingenius diet that will turn you into a slave. Instead, it's just because the data that Bon Appetit makes available is wrong (and their website is probably also wrong, if it's not, you should file an issue here).

**Developer Information**: The Menu is built from json scraped from Bon Appetit's legacy api. How long that will stay active remains to be seen but for now it seems to work.

## Chapel Speakers

**Developer Information**: Chapel speakers can, perhaps be gathered from https://www.wheaton.edu/life-at-wheaton/spiritual-life/chapel/chapel-schedule/ but I'm not sure yet.

## Who's Who

Well, this is more complicated but I think we can get something going with a remote logon type system... We'll probably end up wanting to store keys/tokens/whatever but I think it's possible to hook in esp when wheaton moves whoswho.
